# Covid-19 Worldwide Data Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing data related to the COVID-19 Worldwide pandemic using SQL queries and Tableau Visualization. The dataset provides information about COVID-19 cases, deaths, population, and vaccinations across different locations and continents.

üéØTask:- As a Data Analyst, I have to conduct Exploratary Data Analysis to uncover insights and analyzing the Pandemic Situation which address the different aspects of Covid-19 data.

## üîçSummary of the queries and the insights from that:

1. Death Percentage: This query determines the percentage of deaths in relation to the total number of cases and deaths. It helps us understand how severe the virus is in different locations and time period.

2. Percentage of Population Infected: This query calculates the proportion of the population that has been infected with COVID-19. By comparing the total number of reported cases to the population size, we can assess the virus's spread across different continents and regions.

3. Population with Highest Infection Rate:This query determines which country has the highest COVID-19 infection rate relative to its population. By calculating the percentage of the population that has contracted the virus, it identifies the country with the most significant infection proportion.

4. Highest Death Rate: This query presents the country with the highest COVID-19 mortality rate in relation to its population. By calculating the percentage of the population that has died from the virus, it pinpoints the location with the highest death rate.

5. Continent with the Highest Death Toll: This query finds the continent with the greatest total number of COVID-19 deaths. It provides insight into the pandemic's broader impact on a continental scale.

6. Daily Global COVID-19 Statistics: This query displays the number of new COVID-19 cases and deaths reported worldwide each day. Additionally, it calculates the daily death rate as a percentage of new cases, providing insight into the virus's severity over time.

7. Global Numbers: This query aggregates the global numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths, providing the total counts and the overall death percentage. By ordering the results, it gives a clear view of the cumulative impact of the pandemic.

8. Total Vaccinations per Continent: This query retrieves the total number of COVID-19 vaccinations administered in each continent, providing an overview of the vaccination efforts across different regions.

9. Rolling Total of People Vaccinated: This query calculates the rolling count of people vaccinated and the percentage of the population vaccinated in different locations, providing insights into vaccination progress relative to the population size.

In this project, various SQL techniques such as joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), temporary tables, window functions, and aggregate functions are utilized to extract and analyze insights from the data.
